    You are reading version ({{current_version.name}}) of the documentation associated with a release.
    Releases provide a snapshot of the software from a specific instance in time,
    allowing you to always revert to a working version of the code and view the associated documentation.
    Releases are created at instances when the code is considered stable and feature complete.
    Whereas, the main branch contains the latest features and newest version of the code.
    To view the latest up-to-date documentation for this project,
    please have a look at <a href="{{ vpathto(latest_version.name) }}">{{latest_version.name}}</a>.
    {% else %}
    You're reading the documentation for a development version.
    If you prefer to read the documentation from the last stable release, please have a look at <a href="{{ vpathto(latest_version.name) }}">{{latest_version.name}}</a>.
