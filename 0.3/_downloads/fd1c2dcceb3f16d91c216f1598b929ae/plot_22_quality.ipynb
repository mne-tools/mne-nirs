Opt. Express 7, 5104-5119 (2016).\n\n   Montero Hernandez, Samuel, and Luca Pollonini. \"NIRSplot: a tool for\n   quality assessment of fNIRS scans.\" Optics and the Brain.\n   Optical Society of America, 2020.\n\n   Pollonini, L., Olds, C., Abaya, H., Bortfeld, H., Beauchamp, M.

Hearing research, 309, 84-93.\n\nEnsuring your data is of high quality is essential to good scientific research.\nEvaluating data quality is an essential part of both data collection and\nanalysis.\nFor assessing data quality during data acquisition tools such as PHOEBE are\nhighly recommended, these allow the researcher to address potential problems\nimmediately and modify their experiment to improve the quality of recorded\ndata.\nIt is also important to assess data quality during data analysis.\nMNE-Python and MNE-NIRS provides several mechanisms to allow researchers\nto evaluate the quality of their data and to include this information in their\ndownstream processing.\nDedicated tools exist for quality evaluatiuon such as Montero Hernandez (2020).\nThis tutorial demonstrates methods in MNE-NIRS and MNE-Python for determining\nchannels with poor signal\nquality, and methods for determining time segments of data that are of low\nquality in a subset of channels.\n\nTwo methods are introduced in this tutorial. The scalp coupling index (SCI)\nand peak power (PP) metrics. Both of these methods examine the signal for\nthe presence of a heart beat signal, which indicates that the sensors\nwere in contact with the scalp. For further details see the papers listed\nin the relevant literature sidebar.\n"
