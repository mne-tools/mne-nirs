GLM Analysis (Measured Data)
============================

In this example we analyse data from a real multichannel fNIRS
experiment (see :ref:`tut-fnirs-hrf-sim` for a simplified simulated
analysis). The experiment consists of three conditions
1) tapping on the left hand,
2) tapping on the right hand,
3) a control condition where the participant does nothing.
We use a GLM analysis to examine the neural activity associated with
the different tapping conditions.
An alternative epoching style analysis on the same data can be
viewed in the
`MNE documentation <https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_70_fnirs_processing.html>`_.

This GLM analysis is a wrapper over the excellent
`Nilearn stats <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/tree/master/nilearn/stats>`_.

.. warning::
      This is a work in progress. Comments are appreciated. To provide feedback please create a github issue.

#
# Next we create a model to fit our data to.
# The model consists of various components to model different things we assume
# contribute to the measured signal.
# We model the expected neural response for each experimental condition
# using the SPM haemodynamic response
# function combined with the known stimulus event times and durations
# (as described above).
# We also include a third order polynomial drift and constant to model
# slow fluctuations in the data and a constant DC shift.

#
# The matrices above can be a bit abstract as they encompase multiple

# Instead we can examine a single condition.

# this illustrates when the stimulus was active.

# brain response that lags the stimulus onset and consists of a large positive
# component followed by an undershoot.
