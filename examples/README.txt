Examples
========

The examples gallery provides working code samples demonstrating various
analysis and visualization techniques.

Each example includes a binder link at the base of the page.
Clicking on the binder link will allow you to run the example code in your browser,
upload data, visualise output, all without downloading any code to your computer.

.. warning::

   These examples sometimes use simulations or shortcuts (such as intentionally
   adding noise to recordings) to illustrate a point. Use caution when
   copy-pasting code samples.
