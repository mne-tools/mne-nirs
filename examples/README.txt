========

The examples gallery provides working code samples demonstrating various
analysis and visualization techniques.

.. warning::

   These examples sometimes use simulations or shortcuts (such as intentionally
   adding noise to recordings) to illustrate a point. Use caution when
   copy-pasting code samples.
