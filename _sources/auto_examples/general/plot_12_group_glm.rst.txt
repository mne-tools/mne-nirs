Group Level GLM Analysis
========================

This is an example of a group level GLM based
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
analysis in MNE-NIRS.

   Gorgolewski, Krzysztof J., et al.
   "The brain imaging data structure, a format for organizing and describing
   outputs of neuroimaging experiments." Scientific data 3.1 (2016): 1-9.

Individual level analysis of this data is described in the
:ref:`MNE fNIRS waveform tutorial <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`
and the
:ref:`MNE-NIRS fNIRS GLM tutorial <tut-fnirs-hrf>`
So this example will skim over the individual level details
and focus on the group level aspect of analysis.
Here we describe how to process multiple measurements
and summarise  group level effects both as summary statistics and visually.

The data used in this example is available
`at this location <https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping>`_.
It is a finger tapping example and is briefly described below.
The dataset contains 5 participants.
The example dataset is in
`BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_
format and therefore already contains
information about triggers, condition names, etc.

.. note::

   This tutorial uses data in the BIDS format.
   The BIDS specification for NIRS data is still under development. See:
   `fNIRS BIDS proposal <https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/802>`_.
   As such, to run this tutorial you must use the fNIRS development branch of MNE-BIDS.

   To install the fNIRS development branch of MNE-BIDS run:
   `pip install -U https://codeload.github.com/rob-luke/mne-bids/zip/nirs`.

   MNE-Python. allows you to process fNIRS data that is not in BIDS format too.
   Simply modify the ``read_raw_`` function to match your data type.
   See :ref:`data importing tutorial <tut-importing-fnirs-data>` to learn how
   to use your data with MNE-Python.

.. note::

   Optodes were placed over the motor cortex using the standard NIRX motor
   montage, but with 8 short channels added (see their web page for details).
   To view the sensor locations run
   `raw_intensity.plot_sensors()`.
   A sound was presented to indicate which hand the participant should tap.
   Participants tapped their thumb to their fingers for 5s.
   Conditions were presented in a random order with a randomised inter
   stimulus interval.

Set up directories
------------------
.. sidebar:: Requires MNE-BIDS fNIRS branch

   This section of code requires the MNE-BIDS fNIRS branch.
   See instructions at the top of the page on how to install.
   Alternatively, if your data is not in BIDS format,
   skip to the next section.

First we will define where the raw data is stored. We will analyse a
BIDS dataset. This ensures we have all the metadata we require
without manually specifying the trigger names etc.
We first define where the root directory of our dataset is.
In this example we use the example dataset ``fnirs_motor_group``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-131

    root = fnirs_motor_group.data_path()

    /home/runner/mne_data/fNIRS-motor-group




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-136

And as we are using MNE-BIDS we can create a BIDSPath object.
This class helps to handle all the path wrangling.
We inform the software that we are analysing nirs data that is saved in
the snirf format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-142

    dataset = BIDSPath(root=root, task="tapping",

Define individual analysis
--------------------------

.. sidebar:: Individual analysis procedures

   :ref:`Waveform individual analysis <tut-fnirs-processing>`

   :ref:`GLM individual analysis <tut-fnirs-hrf>`

First we define the analysis that will be applied to each file.
This is a GLM analysis as described in the
:ref:`individual GLM tutorial <tut-fnirs-hrf>`,
so this example will skim over the individual level details.

The analysis extracts a response estimate for each channel,
each region of interest, and computes a contrast between left and right
finger tapping.
We return the raw object and data frames for the computed results.
Information about channels, triggers and their meanings are stored in the
BIDS structure and are automatically obtained when importing the data.

Here we also resample to a 0.3 Hz sample rate just to speed up the example
and use less memory, resampling to 0.6 Hz is a better choice for full
analyses.

.. note::

   The nilearn library does not allow backslash characters in the condition
   name. So we must replace the backslash with an underscore to ensure the
   GLM computation is successful. Hopefully future versions of MNE-NIRS will
   automatically handle these characters, see https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-nirs/issues/420
   for more information. In the meantime use the following code to replace the
   illegal characters.

Run analysis on all participants

Next we loop through the five measurements and run the individual analysis
on each. We append the individual results in to a large dataframe that
will contain the results from all measurements. We create a group dataframe
for the region of interest, channel level, and contrast results.

Visualise Individual results
----------------------------

First we visualise the results from each individual to ensure the
data values look reasonable.
Here we see that we have data from five participants, we plot just the HbO
values and observe they are in the expect range.
We can already see that the control condition is always near zero,
and that the responses look to be contralateral to the tapping hand.

Compute group level results

   Winter, Bodo. "A very basic tutorial for performing linear mixed effects
   analyses." arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.5499 (2013).

   For a summary of linear mixed models in python
   and the relation to lmer see:

   For a summary of these models in the context of fNIRS see section 3.5 of:
   Santosa, H., Zhai, X., Fishburn, F., & Huppert, T. (2018).
   The NIRS brain AnalyzIR toolbox. Algorithms, 11(5), 73.

Next we use a linear mixed effects model to examine the
relation between conditions and our response estimate (theta).
Combinations of 3 fixed effects will be evaluated, ROI (left vs right),
condition (control, tapping/left, tapping/right), and chromophore (HbO, HbR).
With a random effect of subject.
Alternatively, you could export the group dataframe (`df_roi.to_csv()`) and
analyse in your favorite stats program.

We do not explore the modeling procedure in depth here as topics
such model selection and examining residuals are beyond the scope of
this example (see relevant literature).
Alternatively, we could use a robust linear
model by using the code
`roi_model = rlm('theta ~ -1 + ROI:Condition:Chroma', grp_results).fit()`.

Second level analysis with covariates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. sidebar:: Relevant literature

   For a detailed discussion about covariates in fNIRS analysis see
   the seminar by Dr. Jessica Gemignani
   (`youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=emb_logo&v=3E28sT1JI14>`_).

It is simple to extend these models to include covariates.
This dataset is small, so including additional factors may not be
appropriate. However, for instructional purpose, we will include a
covariate of gender. There are 3 females and 2 males in this dataset.
Also, for instructional purpose, we modify the model
above to only explore the difference between the two tapping conditions in
the hbo signal in the right hemisphere.

From the model result we observe that hbo responses in the right hemisphere
are smaller when the right hand was used (as expected for these
contralaterally dominant responses) and there is no significant
effect of gender.

Visualise group results
-----------------------

Now we can summarise the output of the second level model.
This figure shows that the control condition has small responses that
are not significantly different to zero for both HbO
and HbR in both hemispheres.
Whereas clear significant responses are show for the two tapping conditions.
We also observe the the tapping response is
larger in the contralateral hemisphere.
Filled symbols represent HbO, unfilled symbols represent HbR.

Group topographic visualisation
-------------------------------

We can also view the topographic representation of the data
(rather than the ROI summary above).
Here we just plot the oxyhaemoglobin for the two tapping conditions.
First we compute the mixed effects model for each channel (rather
than region of interest as above).
Then we pass these results to the topomap function.

Cortical Surface Projections
----------------------------

The topographic plots above can sometimes be difficult to interpret with
respect to the underlying cortical locations. It is also possible to present
the data by projecting the channel level GLM values to the nearest cortical
surface. This can make it easier to understand the spatial aspects of your
data. Note however, that this is not a complete forward model with photon
migration simulations.
In the figure below we project the group results from the two conditions
to the cortical surface, and also present the contrast results in the same
fashion.
As in the topo plots above you can see that the activity is predominately
contralateral to the side of finger tapping.

Relating Responses to Brain Landmarks
-------------------------------------

.. sidebar:: fOLD Toolbox

   You should use the fOLD toolbox to pick your optode locations
   when designing your experiment.
   The tool is very intuitive and easy to use.
   Be sure to cite the authors if you use their tool or data:

   Morais, Guilherme Augusto Zimeo, Joana Bisol Balardin, and João Ricardo Sato. "fNIRS optodes’ location decider (fOLD): a toolbox for probe arrangement guided by brain regions-of-interest." Scientific reports 8.1 (2018): 1-11.

It can be useful to understand what brain structures
the measured response may have resulted from. Here we illustrate
how to report the brain structures/landmarks that the source
detector pair with the largest response was sensitive to.

First we determine the channel with the largest response.

Next, we query the fOLD dataset to determine the
brain landmarks that this channel is most sensitive to.
MNE-NIRS does not distribute the fOLD toolbox or the data
that they provide. See the Notes section of
:func:`mne_nirs.io.fold_channel_specificity` for more information.

channel specificity to different brain regions.

We observe that the channel with the largest response to tapping
had the greatest specificity to the Precentral Gyrus, which is
the site of the primary motor cortex. This is consistent
with the expectation for a finger tapping task.

Conclusion
----------

This example has demonstrated how to perform a group level analysis
using a GLM approach.
We observed the responses were evoked primarily contralateral to the
hand of tapping and most likely originate from the primary motor cortex.
