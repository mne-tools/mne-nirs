SNIRF Support in MNE
====================

.. sidebar:: .nirs files

   MNE does not support reading ``.nirs`` files. If you have ``.nirs`` files that
   you would like to process in MNE, you should first convert them to SNIRF.
   To convert ``.nirs`` files to SNIRF you can use the Homer3 ``Nirs2Snirf``
   function. See https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf_homer3

SNIRF is a file format for storing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
data. The specification is maintained by the society for functional near infrared
spectroscopy.

MNE Python and MNE-NIRS can be used to read and write SNIRF files respectively.
In this tutorial we demonstrate how to convert your MNE data to
SNIRF and write it to disk and also how to read SNIRF files. We also demonstrate how to
validate that a SNIRF file conforms to the SNIRF specification.

You can read the SNIRF protocol at the official site https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf.

Import raw NIRS data from vendor
--------------------------------

First we import some example data recorded with a NIRX device.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-53

.. code-block:: Python



    fnirs_data_folder = mne.datasets.fnirs_motor.data_path()
    fnirs_raw_dir = os.path.join(fnirs_data_folder, "Participant-1")
    raw_intensity = read_raw_nirx(fnirs_raw_dir).load_data()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-58

Write data as SNIRF
-------------------

Now we can write this data back to disk in the SNIRF format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-62

.. code-block:: Python


    write_raw_snirf(raw_intensity, "test_raw.snirf")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-67

Read back SNIRF file
--------------------

Next we can read back the snirf file.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-71

.. code-block:: Python


    snirf_intensity = read_raw_snirf("test_raw.snirf")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-77

Compare files
-------------

Finally we can compare the data of the original to the SNIRF format and
ensure that the values are the same.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-83

.. code-block:: Python


    assert_allclose(raw_intensity.get_data(), snirf_intensity.get_data())

    snirf_intensity.plot(n_channels=30, duration=300, show_scrollbars=False)

Validate SNIRF File
-------------------

To validate that a file complies with the SNIRF standard you should use the
official SNIRF validator from the Boston University Neurophotonics Center
called ``snirf``. Detailed instructions for this program can be found at
https://github.com/BUNPC/pysnirf2. Below we demonstrate that the files created
by MNE-NIRS are compliant with the specification.

Optical Density
-------------------

MNE-NIRS cal also be used to write optical density data to SNIRF files.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-112

.. code-block:: Python


    raw_od = optical_density(raw_intensity)
    write_raw_snirf(raw_od, "test_raw_od.snirf")

Haemoglobin
-------------------

And it can write valid haemoglobin data to SNIRF files.
