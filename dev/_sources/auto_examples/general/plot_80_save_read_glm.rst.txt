Save and load GLM results
=========================

This is an example of how to save and load
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
GLM results from analysis in MNE-NIRS.
As computation can be expensive and time consuming it can be useful
to store computed results to disk, so that you can query the results later.
For example, to remake a figure or answer a new scientific question.

For a description of the analysis in this tutorial see the
:ref:`MNE-NIRS individual GLM tutorial <tut-fnirs-hrf>` and
:ref:`MNE-NIRS group GLM tutorial <tut-fnirs-group>`.
This tutorial will simply focus on saving and loading data.

The data used in this example is available
`at this location <https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping>`_.
It is a finger tapping example and is briefly described below.
The dataset contains 5 participants.
The example dataset is in
`BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_
format and therefore already contains
information about triggers, condition names, etc.

.. note::

   This tutorial uses data stored using
   `the BIDS format <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/11-near-infrared-spectroscopy.html>`_
   :footcite:p:`luke2023bids`.

   MNE-Python allows you to process fNIRS data that is not in BIDS format.
   Simply modify the ``read_raw_`` function to match your data type.
   See :ref:`data importing tutorial <tut-importing-fnirs-data>` to learn how
   to use your data with MNE-Python.

Set up directories
------------------

First we will define where the raw data is stored. We will analyse a
BIDS dataset, note that the BIDS specification for NIRS data is still
under development and you will need to install the development branch
as described above.

We first define the root directory of our dataset.
