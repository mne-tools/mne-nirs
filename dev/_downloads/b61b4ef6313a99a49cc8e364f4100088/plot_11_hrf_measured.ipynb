The experiment consists of three conditions:\n\n1. tapping with the left hand,\n2. tapping with the right hand,\n3. a control condition where the participant does nothing.\n\nWe use a GLM analysis to examine the neural activity associated with\nthe different tapping conditions.\nAn alternative epoching style analysis on the same data can be\nviewed in the\n`waveform analysis example <tut-fnirs-processing>`.\nSee\n`Luke et al (2021) <https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics/volume-8/issue-2/025008/Analysis-methods-for-measuring-passive-auditory-fNIRS-responses-generated-by/10.1117/1.NPh.8.2.025008.short>`_\nfor a comparison of the epoching and GLM approaches.\n\nThis GLM analysis is a wrapper over the excellent\n`Nilearn GLM <http://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.glm>`_.\n   :depth: 2\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Parts of this tutorial require the latest development version of MNE-Python.
