[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rob-luke/mne-nirs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rob-luke/mne-nirs)


**mne-nirs** is an MNE compatible NIRS processing package. MNE already has support for most common analysis procedures (see [tutorial](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_70_fnirs_processing.html)), this package adds additional helper functions, algorithms, and plotting.
