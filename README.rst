**mne-nirs** is an MNE compatible NIRS processing package. 

MNE already has support for most common analysis procedures (see `tutorial <https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_70_fnirs_processing.html>`_), this package adds additional helper functions, algorithms, and plotting. Functionality that is widely used from this package may be merged in to MNE.
